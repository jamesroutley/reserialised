     <h2>Chapter XLVIII.</h2>
<p>The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a
week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf below Bridge; the
time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and, undecided where to dine, I had
strolled up into Cheapside, and was strolling along it, surely the most
unsettled person in all the busy concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my
shoulder by some one overtaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers’s hand, and he passed it
through my arm.</p>
<p>“As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together. Where are you
bound for?”</p>
<p>“For the Temple, I think,” said I.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know?” said Mr. Jaggers.</p>
<p>“Well,” I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in cross-examination,
“I do <em>not</em> know, for I have not made up my mind.”</p>
<p>“You are going to dine?” said Mr. Jaggers. “You don’t mind admitting that, I
suppose?”</p>
<p>“No,” I returned, “I don’t mind admitting that.”</p>
<p>“And are not engaged?”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind admitting also that I am not engaged.”</p>
<p>“Then,” said Mr. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”</p>
<p>I was going to excuse myself, when he added, “Wemmick’s coming.” So I changed my
excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered, serving for the
beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little
Britain, while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows, and
the street lamp-lighters, scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders
on in the midst of the afternoon’s bustle, were skipping up and down and running
in and out, opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower
at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.</p>
<p>At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,
hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the business of the
day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers’s fire, its rising and falling flame made
the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at
bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse, fat office candles that dimly lighted
Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as
if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients.</p>
<p>We went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And, as soon
as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have thought of
making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much as a look to
Wemmick’s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no objection to catching
his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it was not to be done. He turned his
eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he raised them from the table, and was as dry and
distant to me as if there were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.</p>
<p>“Did you send that note of Miss Havisham’s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?” Mr. Jaggers
asked, soon after we began dinner.</p>
<p>“No, sir,” returned Wemmick; “it was going by post, when you brought Mr. Pip
into the office. Here it is.” He handed it to his principal instead of to me.</p>
<p>“It’s a note of two lines, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, “sent up to me
by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your address. She tells me
that she wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her.
You’ll go down?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those terms.</p>
<p>“When do you think of going down?”</p>
<p>“I have an impending engagement,” said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was putting
fish into the post-office, “that renders me rather uncertain of my time. At
once, I think.”</p>
<p>“If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,” said Wemmick to Mr. Jaggers,
“he needn’t write an answer, you know.”</p>
<p>Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled that I
would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass of wine, and looked with
a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not at me.</p>
<p>“So, Pip! Our friend the Spider,” said Mr. Jaggers, “has played his cards. He
has won the pool.”</p>
<p>It was as much as I could do to assent.</p>
<p>“Hah! He is a promising fellow—in his way—but he may not have it all his own
way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to be found out
first. If he should turn to, and beat her—”</p>
<p>“Surely,” I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, “you do not seriously
think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and beat her,
he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be a question of
intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance work to give an opinion how
a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances, because it’s a
toss-up between two results.”</p>
<p>“May I ask what they are?”</p>
<p>“A fellow like our friend the Spider,” answered Mr. Jaggers, “either beats or
cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but he either beats
or cringes. Ask Wemmick <em>his</em> opinion.”</p>
<p>“Either beats or cringes,” said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself to me.</p>
<p>“So here’s to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,” said Mr. Jaggers, taking a decanter of
choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of us and for himself,
“and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady’s satisfaction! To the
satisfaction of the lady <em>and</em> the gentleman, it never will be. Now, Molly,
Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow you are to-day!”</p>
<p>She was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the table. As
she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two, nervously muttering
some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers, as she spoke, arrested my
attention.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” said Mr. Jaggers.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,” said I, “was rather painful to
me.”</p>
<p>The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood looking at
her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or whether he had more
to say to her and would call her back if she did go. Her look was very intent.
Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable occasion very
lately!</p>
<p>He dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained before me as
plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those hands, I looked at those
eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I compared them with other hands, other
eyes, other hair, that I knew of, and with what those might be after twenty
years of a brutal husband and a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and
eyes of the housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come
over me when I last walked—not alone—in the ruined garden, and through the
deserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I saw a face
looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach window; and how it had
come back again and had flashed about me like lightning, when I had passed in a
carriage—not alone—through a sudden glare of light in a dark street. I thought
how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre, and
how such a link, wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed
by a chance swift from Estella’s name to the fingers with their knitting action,
and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this woman was
Estella’s mother.</p>
<p>Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed the
sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said the subject
was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the wine again, and went on
with his dinner.</p>
<p>Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the room was
very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands were Estella’s
hands, and her eyes were Estella’s eyes, and if she had reappeared a hundred
times I could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was
the truth.</p>
<p>It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round, quite as a
matter of business,—just as he might have drawn his salary when that came
round,—and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of perpetual readiness for
cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine, his post-office was as
indifferent and ready as any other post-office for its quantity of letters. From
my point of view, he was the wrong twin all the time, and only externally like
the Wemmick of Walworth.</p>
<p>We took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping among Mr.
Jaggers’s stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right twin was on his way
back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down Gerrard Street in the Walworth
direction, before I found that I was walking arm in arm with the right twin, and
that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air.</p>
<p>“Well!” said Wemmick, “that’s over! He’s a wonderful man, without his living
likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine with him,—and I
dine more comfortably unscrewed.”</p>
<p>I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t say it to anybody but yourself,” he answered. “I know that what is
said between you and me goes no further.”</p>
<p>I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham’s adopted daughter, Mrs. Bentley
Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of the Aged and of
Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned Miss Skiffins, and stopped
in the street to blow his nose, with a roll of the head, and a flourish not
quite free from latent boastfulness.</p>
<p>“Wemmick,” said I, “do you remember telling me, before I first went to Mr.
Jaggers’s private house, to notice that housekeeper?”</p>
<p>“Did I?” he replied. “Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,” he added, suddenly,
“I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.”</p>
<p>“A wild beast tamed, you called her.”</p>
<p>“And what do <em>you</em> call her?”</p>
<p>“The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?”</p>
<p>“That’s his secret. She has been with him many a long year.”</p>
<p>“I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in being
acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me goes no
further.”</p>
<p>“Well!” Wemmick replied, “I don’t know her story,—that is, I don’t know all of
it. But what I do know I’ll tell you. We are in our private and personal
capacities, of course.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for murder,
and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I believe had some
gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it was up, as you may
suppose.”</p>
<p>“But she was acquitted.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Jaggers was for her,” pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning, “and
worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a desperate case, and it was
comparatively early days with him then, and he worked it to general admiration;
in fact, it may almost be said to have made him. He worked it himself at the
police-office, day after day for many days, contending against even a committal;
and at the trial where he couldn’t work it himself, sat under counsel, and—every
one knew—put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,—a
woman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger. It was a
case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman in Gerrard Street
here had been married very young, over the broomstick (as we say), to a tramping
man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy. The murdered woman,—more a
match for the man, certainly, in point of years—was found dead in a barn near
Hounslow Heath. There had been a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was
bruised and scratched and torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and
choked. Now, there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this
woman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr. Jaggers
principally rested his case. You may be sure,” said Wemmick, touching me on the
sleeve, “that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then, though he
sometimes does now.”</p>
<p>I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner party.</p>
<p>“Well, sir!” Wemmick went on; “it happened—happened, don’t you see?—that this
woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her apprehension, that she
looked much slighter than she really was; in particular, her sleeves are always
remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that her arms had quite a
delicate look. She had only a bruise or two about her,—nothing for a tramp,—but
the backs of her hands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with
finger-nails? Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot
of brambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not have got
through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles were actually
found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that the brambles in
question were found on examination to have been broken through, and to have
little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there.
But the boldest point he made was this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof
of her jealousy, that she was under strong suspicion of having, at about the
time of the murder, frantically destroyed her child by this man—some three years
old—to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way: “We say
these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and we show you the
brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set up the hypothesis
that she destroyed her child. You must accept all consequences of that
hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have destroyed her child, and the
child in clinging to her may have scratched her hands. What then? You are not
trying her for the murder of her child; why don’t you? As to this case, if you
<em>will</em> have scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted
for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them?”
“To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr. Jaggers was altogether too many for the
jury, and they gave in.”</p>
<p>“Has she been in his service ever since?”</p>
<p>“Yes; but not only that,” said Wemmick, “she went into his service immediately
after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since been taught one thing
and another in the way of her duties, but she was tamed from the beginning.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember the sex of the child?”</p>
<p>“Said to have been a girl.”</p>
<p>“You have nothing more to say to me to-night?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.”</p>
<p>We exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for my
thoughts, though with no relief from the old.</p>
